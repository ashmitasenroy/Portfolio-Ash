### üéØ Purpose & Design Philosophy

The primary goal of this portfolio was to create a professional, clean, and extremely fast website to showcase my work. I focused on a **minimalist design philosophy** to ensure that the content‚Äîmy projects and skills‚Äîis the star of the show.

Key design principles included:
- **Fast Load Times:** Using an optimized build process and efficient code.
- **Full Responsiveness:** Ensuring a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile.
- **Clear Navigation:** Making it easy for visitors (like recruiters!) to find what they're looking for.
